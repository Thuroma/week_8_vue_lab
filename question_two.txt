This means that a Vue property was specefied in the html
 but it was not returned, or provided a value, by the Vue.createApp() 
 in the script. The problem is that the html element is not being bound
 to the data from the model. This can be fixed by returning the 
 variable's value in the Data() section. The page can still be loaded but
 any display depending on the value will not be drawn.
